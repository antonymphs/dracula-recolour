original is https://github.com/slowstab/dracula (idk how forking works tbh)

i recoloured the dracula theme to be my favorite colour (7598FF) cuz i wanted it too

works best in conjunction with a different theme as this'll just recolour certain text and highlight elements in native discord, i was TOO lazy to do the rest

quite awesome infact
